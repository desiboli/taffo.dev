    Hi, I'm Mustafa a Senior Frontend Developer with over a decade of experience
    building fast, responsive, and reliable web interfaces. I have a solid
    foundation in frontend development, with a touch of design expertise and a
    keen eye for UX/UI to ensure every detail feels just right. When I'm not
    coding, I'm usually exploring the latest in web tech or enjoying time with
    family — but always ready for the next big challenge!

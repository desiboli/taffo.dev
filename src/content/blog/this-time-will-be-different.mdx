#### Why This Time Will Be Different

As a Developer, I’ve spent years building and rebuilding my own portfolio site. If you’re a developer yourself, you probably know the cycle: excitement for a fresh start, late nights perfecting every pixel, tweaking animations, picking the “perfect” stack… only for the site to barely last a month before I’m itching to start over.

I’ve probably published more portfolio versions than I care to count. Each time, I’ve felt something was missing, something that didn’t quite represent me or my work in the way I wanted. Each version had its own purpose—a focus on my projects, a deep dive into UI/UX, a clean slate to showcase my skills—but none of them felt like “home.” And so, they never lasted.

For a long time, my goal was to make the site look as cool as possible, taking inspiration from sites on Awwwards. I aimed to match those impressive animations, layouts, and modern effects. But as I kept revisiting this approach, I realized I wanted something else—something more grounded. This time, I’ve shifted the focus of my portfolio. Rather than making it flashy or modern, I’ve opted for a super clean, simple, and minimalistic design, where the emphasis is on documenting my journey, sharing my learnings, and creating a home for my insights and projects.

In many ways, this is a commitment to embracing my own work and allowing it to grow and evolve with me. There might be small imperfections here and there, but that’s okay. This time, I’m keeping it real.

If you’re reading this, welcome! I’m looking forward to seeing where this journey leads and to finally having a place to document it all.
